# Module: Catalog

Catalog is a module for [Fork CMS](http://www.fork-cms.com).
It lets you create and show products (i.e. clothing, bicycles or whatever) on your website.
Your visitors can view, discuss and order (for now without paying methods) products.

## Versions

* Version 1.x.x works on ForkCMS 3.6.x
* Version 2.x.x works on ForkCMS 3.7.x 

## Download

Download latest release from [the release page](https://github.com/timvanwolfswinkel/catalog/releases).

## Installation

Visit the [Fork CMS Documentation](http://www.fork-cms.com/community/documentation/detail/getting-started/adding-modules) to learn how to install a module.

NOTE: The .zip file is too large to upload within the cms itself (because of example data). You can upload the folders in the /Backend and /Frontend of your website.
